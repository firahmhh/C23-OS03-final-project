# Machine Learning Notes

Progress:
1. Collect the data related to our features: Price Prediction(from Kementrian Kelautan dan Perikanan Indonesia), Freshness Detection( using Fish Images, Ideal storage temperature, and Ideal storage time)
2. Exploratory data analysis and choosing best learning algorithm related to the problem,
3. Create and training model for our features: Price Prediction and Freshness detection(using images of fresh fish and spoiled fish for dataset;ideal storage temperature and time for the other approachment method),
4. Improving model by changing outlier of the data and try other model infrastucture and so on.


Additional note : 
Several dataset that we used are belong to Fishku's Company so we can't attach the data in this repository due to NDA
